/**
 * A Cgroup version 2 file-system based Resource calculator without the process tree features.
 *
 * Warning: this implementation will not work properly when configured
 * using the mapreduce.job.process-tree.class job property.
 * Theoretically the ResourceCalculatorProcessTree can be configured
 * using the mapreduce.job.process-tree.class job property, however it
 * has a dependency on an instantiated ResourceHandlerModule,
 * which is only initialised in the NodeManager process and not in the containers.
 *
 * Limitation:
 * The ResourceCalculatorProcessTree class can be configured using the
 * mapreduce.job.process-tree.class property within a MapReduce job.
 * However, it is important to note that instances of ResourceCalculatorProcessTree operate
 * within the context of a MapReduce task. This presents a limitation:
 * these instances do not have access to the ResourceHandlerModule,
 * which is only initialized within the NodeManager process
 * and not within individual containers where MapReduce tasks execute.
 * As a result, the current implementation of ResourceCalculatorProcessTree is incompatible
 * with the mapreduce.job.process-tree.class property. This incompatibility arises
 * because the ResourceHandlerModule is essential for managing and monitoring resource usage,
 * and without it, the ResourceCalculatorProcessTree cannot function as intended
 * within the confines of a MapReduce task. Therefore, any attempts to utilize this class
 * through the mapreduce.job.process-tree.class property
 * will not succeed under the current architecture.
